Many people say that I resemble Amu from the Indonesian webtoon Wee, and I feel the same way. Amu is a character who is cheerful, full of energy, and always tries to see the positive side of everything. She has a unique personality playful, a little mischievous, but also sincere and caring toward those around her.

Like Amu, I love exploring new things, expressing myself through creativity, and embracing new challenges. The digital and tech world is where I thrive, but I also enjoy art and design as a way to bring my imagination to life.
